# AE-0139 — carousel-presentation + persona-quality + conversation + knowledge + identity modules

Status: Ready
Tier: T2
Priority: High
Type: Task
Area: Frontend
Owner: Unassigned
Agent Lane: planner → architect → developer → qa → release
Branch: feat/ae-0139-remaining-context-modules
Kanban Card: TBD
Created: 2026-06-16

## Goal

Migrate the remaining features into their modules: carousel->carousel-presentation (preview/review/refinement); persona+personas+rubrics->persona-quality (consolidating the persona/personas duplication); chat->conversation; knowledge->knowledge; auth/session->identity - each behind a public contract.

## Problem

Today `frontend/src/features/**` is feature-organized with 23 grandfathered cross-feature imports and no module public-contract boundary; feature names diverge from the backend bounded-context glossary, persona/personas are duplicated, and two `useBlogPosts()` hooks conflate carousel articles with first-class blog posts. The frontend needs the same bounded-context ownership + enforceable boundaries the backend now has.

## Scope

Behavior-preserving (App Router URLs + UI unchanged; green gates held; boundary ratchet down-only). Frontend-only. Work is scoped to this ticket's slice of the feature->module migration per `docs/plans/phase-7-frontend-alignment.md`; re-export shims keep `@/` paths resolving during the move.

## Non-Goals

- No backend changes (frontend-only).
- No App Router URL changes.
- No UI/behavior change; no test deletion or gate weakening.
- No exhaustive component re-homing or legacy-shim removal (deferred to Phase 8).

## Modularization Alignment (2026-06-16)

Phase 7 of the modularization plan (§Phase 7 "Align the frontend"). **Behavior-preserving** frontend
reorganization: App Router URLs unchanged, the green gates (typecheck + eslint + lint:boundaries + 822 Vitest
tests + check:legacy) stay green per ticket, and the feature/module-boundary ratchet only goes DOWN. Features
migrate into `frontend/src/modules/<context>` sharing the backend glossary (knowledge/identity/conversation/
editorial/presentation/publishing + editorial-operations/persona-quality), each behind a public contract;
re-export shims keep `@/` paths resolving during migration (object-identity, mirroring backend AE-0126).
ZERO gate-gaming (no new eslint-disable/@ts-ignore/@ts-expect-error/skipped tests/lowered thresholds/baseline
additions). Precondition: Phase 6 (PR #20) merged. See `docs/plans/phase-7-frontend-alignment.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each remaining feature SHALL live under its target module behind a public contract
- [ ] persona + personas SHALL be consolidated under persona-quality (no duplicate)
- [ ] App Router URLs + UI unchanged; re-export shims keep old paths resolving
- [ ] The boundary ratchet SHALL ratchet DOWN or hold; typecheck/eslint/test green

## Gherkin Scenarios

Not applicable — behavior-preserving reorganization; verified by the green-gate safety net (typecheck + eslint
+ lint:boundaries + Vitest 822 + check:legacy) and the App Router URL inventory.
