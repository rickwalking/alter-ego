"""Command / result value objects for the presentation editorial-port surface.

These typed objects are the data carried across the **editorial → presentation**
boundary (AE-0121). They are deliberately small, frozen, and free of the
carousel ORM: the editorial workflow constructs a command, hands it to a
presentation port through the public facade, and receives a result back. The
ports themselves are defined in :mod:`rag_backend.modules.presentation.domain.ports`;
the concrete adapters that delegate to the unchanged application services live in
:mod:`rag_backend.modules.presentation.infrastructure.editorial_workflow_ports`.

Behavior-preserving: every object mirrors the inputs/outputs the existing
design / images / export / artifact-build call sites already pass — no new
behavior, only a typed contract over what crosses the boundary.

The ``ContentFormatProducer`` extension point (see ``ports``) is a
PRESENTATION-SPECIFIC boundary: :class:`ProduceFormat` is its single command and
:class:`ProducedArtifact` its single result. There is intentionally NO generic
multi-format framework — carousel is the only producer today; a second format
adds a second producer, not an abstraction layer.
